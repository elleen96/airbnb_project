Airbnb is the biggest short term vacation rental platform in the world, with more than 7 million listings globally. The website allows homeowners to rent out a room or their entire home for a set period of time to travellers. According to Priceonomics, hosts earn an average of $924 per month, nearly 3 times as much as other workers in the gig sharing econonomy. Clearly, hosting on Airbnb can be extremely profitable, however getting the pricing strategy right is important in ensuring that hosts get the most out of their listing. Overpricing the property would result in fewer bookings, while underpricing the property would mean losing out on potential profit. In this project, we analyse Airbnb listing data in Copenhagen to determine the factors that influence Airbnb prices and build a model to predict prices.


The takeaways from this analysis are:
1) The most expensive time to book a room in Copenhagen is during the summer months.
2) The top 4 factors that lead to a higher Airbnb listing price include the number of people a place can accommodate, the number of beds/bedrooms and cleaning fee.

Predictive analysis was performed on the data to predict the listing price of an Airbnb using RandomForest Regressor and XGBoosting - a MAE of 283 DKK was achieved using RF and MAE of 278 was achieved using XGBoosting.
